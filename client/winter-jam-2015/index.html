			<h2>What is the Fresh4Less Winter Solstice Jam?</h2>
			<p>The Winter Solstice Jam is a competition to create an
			interactive project from scratch in 24 hours. You get to choose
			when you begin your 24 hour entry, so you can fit it into your
			schedule.</p>
			<p>Everyone who participates must judge every other entry and vote
			for their favorite. The winner and runner-up will both win a prize.
			Collaboration is not allowed.</p>
			<h2>What can I enter?</h2>
			<p>Anything interactive. It's up to you what interactive means.
			Your entry doesn't necessarily need to require a computer to be
			experienced, but it does need to be submitted on this webpage so
			anyone in the world can experience it for themself. Your entry
			should be related to the theme in some way.</p>
			<p>The majority of your entry should be designed and created during
			the 24 hours you participate in the jam.  It's okay to use
			frameworks, templates, and some art and audio assets not created
			during the jam.</p>
			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p>Whenever you're ready, click the button above to join the jam.
			Enter your name and you'll be given a <em>secret code</em>. Once
			you enter, the 24 hour timer starts ticking down. You can submit
			files by using the submission list below and entering your
			<em>secret code</em>. You may submit as many times as you would
			like before the countdown reaches zero.  Once it hits zero, you
			will not be able to upload any more files.</p>
